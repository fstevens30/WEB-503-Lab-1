### Class notes
```
Learnt the basics of HTML and CSS as well as learning how to link HTML, CSS and JS together to create a static webpage.  

 

Ali showed many useful extensions including GitHub copilot which will be very helpful for assessments. 

 

Theming in CSS was helpful to learn as we can theme all elements under a certain tag or only specific ones with class and ID tags. 

 

Using MDN web Docs to create different tags in HTML, my 10 were; 

 

<h1> - A header tag for important text. 

 

<p> - Paragraph tag for large blocks of text. 

 

<ol> - Ordered list, list elements are orders with 1. List Item etc. 

 

<ul> - Unordered list, list elements are not ordered, e.g. - List Item 

 

<li> - Creates a list item, can be nested in either of the above types of lists. 

 

<button> - Creates a button. 

 

<progress> - Creates a progress bar which can be modified with tags and scripts, my one is static. 

 

<code> - Creates a code block for code examples, mine is nested in a <p> tag. 

 

<blockquote> - Creates a block quote. 

 

<dl> - Creates a list of definitions. 

 

<dt> - Creates a term to be defined. 

 

<dd> - Defines the above term. 

 

<footer> - Creates a footer at the bottom of the document. 

 

<br> Creates a break between lines, and doesnâ€™t require a closing tag.
